# How to get started with `node-opencv`

* Note: This is only tested on Ubuntu 14.04
* Run `build_docker.sh <image_name>`, where <image_name> is the name of a new image. Example `build_docker.sh nicktardif/node-opencv`
* This will build a docker container for you. The docker container will already have the most recent version of `node-opencv` and will also allow the Docker container to access your X server for graphical applications
* Run `runDocker.sh`, which will start up a shell within the Docker container

* NOTE: These programs should have more command line arguments and I'll add them in the future
